GWGEN: A global weather generator for daily data
================================================

Welcome! This synthesis of FORTRAN and Python is a globally applicable
weather generator inspired by the original WGEN weather generator of
[Richardson1981]_ and parameterized through a global dataset of [GHCN]_ and
[EECRA]_ data. A paper with the scientific documentation is in progress, the
`technical documentation`_ is hosted on github.
